    "text": "I am a PhD student in Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. I am interested in applied microeconomic research with a focus on environmental and natural resource economics, sustainable development, land use economics, economic issues of Indigenous communities, and spatial analysis. Specifically, I am currently working on research involving ecosystem services, economic development, efficient land use, and property rights. I am currently an active member of the NatCap TEEMs and I formerly worked as a Student Research Associate at the Center for Health Economics and Policy Studies (CHEPS) at San Diego State University. I completed my MA in Economics at San Diego State University and my BA in Business Administration at Eastern Washington University."
